# TASK/PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
Task 1: Static Portfolio Website (CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS Internship)

This repository contains the source code for a professional, fully responsive static portfolio website. This project was developed as Task 1 of the CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS Software Developer Internship program, demonstrating core front-end expertise and adherence to sophisticated design principles, including the Golden Ratio ($\phi$).

## Project Overview
The website serves as a technical portfolio showcasing my skills and providing placeholders for the subsequent internship projects. The primary objective was to ensure the design achieved visual harmony and full responsiveness using only pure HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.

## Key Features:
Multi-File Architecture: Built using the required structure: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Aesthetic Theme: Implements a high-contrast Dark Mode using a custom palette (near-black background and professional blue accent - #3b82f6).
Adaptive Design: Mobile-First Responsiveness guaranteed via extensive use of CSS Media Queries across all major breakpoints.

## Interactivity: 
Features a functional mobile navigation toggle implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

## Technical Implementation
The site's technical foundation is centered on pure CSS3 to achieve advanced layout and proportional scaling without relying on external frameworks.

1. The Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$) Implementation
Strict adherence to the Golden Ratio was a core requirement, applied across two key areas:
Layout: On desktop screens (min-width: 1025px), the primary content area (About Me and Skills) is divided into columns using the $\phi$ proportion for the main content and the secondary content.

2. Pure CSS and Maintainability
All styling leverages modern CSS features to demonstrate maintainability:
CSS Variables: Used extensively to manage the specific color palette, typography scale, and consistent 8-pixel spacing rhythm.
Semantic Structure: HTML5 provides a clean, accessible, and semantically rich structure.
Responsiveness: Flexible units (rem, em, %) are combined with Media Queries to ensure proportional layout adaptation across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5 (Semantic Structure), 
2. CSS3 (Custom Layout, Media Queries, CSS Variables), 
3. Vanilla JavaScript (Mobile Menu Toggle, Intersection Observer for fade-in animations), 
4. Lucide Icons (For professional interface elements)
